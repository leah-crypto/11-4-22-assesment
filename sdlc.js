// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation ***4
// Design ***3
// Maintain ***6
// Analysis of Requirements ***2
// Testing & Integration  ***5
// Planning ***1

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

  "Second step. Bussiness rules as well as data models";
const Design = "Third step. Creating and designing the software.";

  "Fifth step. Software is tested for quaility and efficiency";
